  <h2>Common Animals</h2>
    <h3>Bat Ray</h3>
      <img src="http://www.aquariumofpacific.org/images/olc/bat_ray.jpg" width="280" hight="320">
      <h4>Bat Ray 
      Myliobatis Californica</h4>

      <p>The Bat Ray, a member of the eagle ray(Myliobatidae) family, can be found on the bottoms of sandy bays, in kelp forests, and in sloughs stretching from the Oregon coast to the Gulf of California.  Brown to almost black in color, the bat ray can be best identified by its bat-like pectoral fins, used to detect the pulses of water expelled by the sand’s underlying prey. Its diet consists mainly of small fishes, mollusks, and crustaceans, some of which the ray obtains by digging steep holes in the sand with its snout and pectoral fins. Bat rays also have venomous barbs on their tails, which they use to defend themselves. As you hike along the Bay Trail, you may see these rays skimming the surface of the slough, their dark wingtips breaking the water’s surface.</p>

         <img src="http://www.wra-ca.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SMHM-Rob-Schell-279x279.jpg">
         <h4>Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse: Southern subspecies
       Reithrodontomys raviventris. Also known as "Red-bellied Harvest Mouse”</h4>
           <p>The Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse, a federal endangered species, is a small rodent native to the San Francisco Bay Area. Distinguishing it from its white-bellied northern brothers, the southern subspecies of the harvest mouse is characterized by grooved teeth, dark brown fur, and a cinnamon-colored belly. As the name implies, the mouse lives amongst thick salt marsh vegetation, particularly <a herf="https://jsfiddle.net/Banana_Turtle/fkwbLhyf/1/">pickleweed</a>
 <!-- CHANGE THIS WHEN THE TIMES COMES-->(Salicornia), which is both its main food source and favored habitat. As well as food, these plants act as critical protection from predators for the cover-dependent mice. The Salt Marsh Mouse’s population is currently being threatened by habitat loss due to human land development, rise in sea level, and on a smaller scale, the invasive plant cordgrass(Spartina) as it replaces many of the plants native to California’s estuaries.</p>
       
      <ul>
       <h4>Quick Facts:</h4>
         <li>Length: 2.75-3.0 inches </li>
         <li>Weight: 0.3-0.5 ounces </li>
         <li>Lifespan: 8-12 months</li>
         <li>Diet:  Grass, seeds, and flowering plants such as pickleweed weed and salt grass. Fresh grass is eaten during the winter. </li>
         <li>Predators: Snakes, owls, hawks, red fox, skunks, cats</li>
         <li>Nests: Loose clumps of grass upon the surface of the ground</li>
         <li>Primarily nocturnal, they may also be seen at sunset.</li>
         <li>Possess superior ability in swimming, floating, and climbing; this allows them to survive the tidal floods that occur regularly in their native habitats.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The southern subspecies of the Salt Marsh Mouse lives in the southern and southeastern shore of the San Francisco Bay ,namely the San Mateo, Alameda, Santa Clara counties. It drinks freshwater and saltwater alike, for it has the ability to thrive solely on either. <!-- Jane will do this--></p>
